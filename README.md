## **Introduction**


This is be a medical related app called
“Medulate” created in android studio. It allows patients to regulate themselves, ensuring that they stay on track with their health and medication. 

This has been achieved in the following ways:

* Pills reminder - helps users take their medication on time by setting a reminder via date and time. 

* Diary - allows users to insert personal notes. This feature helps them to keep track of their symptoms, medications and conditions. 
Each patient has their own user authentication, which was implemented using firebase.

## **What I Learnt**

* Connecting and populating a database.
* Capabilities of the Realtime database and Firestore. 
* Model and manage mobile application development using a range of methods and tools
* Learnt the techniques for deploying and testing mobile applications, and for enhancing their performance and scalability.
* Become familiar with different User Interface and Design elements, that can be used to construct the application interface on a mobile platform.
* Understanding the enterprise-scale requirements of mobile applications and business trends impacting mobile application development.
* Demonstrate knowledge of the capabilities of a range of mobile devices & frameworks, and contrast different programming platforms.
* The characterisation and architecture of mobile applications


## **Potential Future Features**

* The pills reminder could have a separate activity to view the various reminders
that the user has set. By doing this it allows them to manage numerous alarms
which they could edit, delete or even set to be triggered on a daily basis. This
would be extremely beneficial, as it would save them from having to set
a different reminder for the same medication every day. 
* Allowing Patients to delete reminders if they’ve stopped taking a certain medication or easily alter the instructions if their dose has increased or decreased. This improvement would be more valuable for patients that are taking a vast amount of medication.

* Voice recognition feature for
the pills reminder which would benefit people with certain disabilities. E.g., if a patient found it difficult to use the keypad on the mobile device, it would save
them the hassle and make it easier for them to carry out the tasks on the app. 
This would also help increase the number of users, as it provides an alternative
method which they may find more preferable.
